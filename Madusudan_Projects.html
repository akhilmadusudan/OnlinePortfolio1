        <h4><strong>Objective:</strong></h4> To build a Palm Pilot similar to the original one. The new product should have the look and feel of the original pilot, including the use of a stylus for graphical input. They should take advantage of the latest
        technology, including full-color touchscreens, Bluetooth connectivity to interact with and augment cell phone apps, and a built-in NFC antenna for data transfer. Our E.S Palm consists of all of these characteristics and still manages to incorparates
        new and high-demand features that have the potential to gain a large consumer base.</p>

      <h2> Description:</h2>
      <p>For this project, my group and me were given certain constraints, a rubric, and some parts that were optional to use. My role was to model the back camera, screen, card-holder, and to create a marketing presentation. Our main goal was to engineer
        a palm pilot that would carry daily essential needs with a touch of security. After discussing and researching past Palm Pilots we came up with a few features that would be more convenient for people. Our E.S Palm features a 4k DSLR camera, Intel
        I9 processor for fast computing, a Bluetooth module to track personal belongings, and a card holder that can be only unlocked with voice recognition. After modeling our design, we made a product presentation to sell our idea.Throughout the construction
        of our E.S Palm device, we suffered from dificult problems such as wrong dimensions and measurements. This messed up the overall design of our palm pilot, but we were able to tackle this by comparing measurements within the group efficently and
        adapting with what we had. Overall, my group and I learned a lot about selling our product and designing certain principles that can attract a mass audience.I was also able to improve my management qualities by keep the group motivated and focused
        on what they needed to accomplish. </p>

          <h4><strong>Objective:</strong></h4> To create a fun and challenging game using the Scratch platform. We needed to create a game that utilizes multiple sprites and backdrops. We were also required to document our game and explain the instructions
          and features of our design.
          <br>
          <h2> Description:</h2>
          <p>My partner and I decided to create a game where we would include our favorite sport, basketball. We came across an arleady existing game on Scratch, on which we decided to remix by incorparating multiple backdrops, more sprites and more features
            to make the game even more appealing. I took on the role of creating multiple levels and stages for the game, as well as documenting important decisions we made and features added. During the development of our game, we came across some issues
            such lagy transitions from level to level and wrong sprites popping out on the wrong stages. We were able to overcome these difficulties by discussing different silutions and remaining calm and collected. This helped us solve our problems
            which demonstrated our superior leadership qualities Overall, I learned efficent ways to put patterns and algorithims together by using less code and also learned how to manage my time properly to get the most done out of our time.

   <h2>The Adventures of Mr.Brown's Classroom</h2>
    <br>
    <h5> <strong>Project: Python Escape Room Challenge</strong> 
      <h5> <strong>Course:</strong> AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP)</h5>
      <h5><strong> Duration:</strong> January 22 to January 30</h5>
      <a class="button" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYVVhinbsn2R9r1q4kbt6Jj3NIMfYKV4LDxiawrVEMs/edit" class="button" target="_blank">Click Here For Project Documentation</a>
      
        <p><h4><strong>Objective:</strong></h4>
To create an Escape Room game that utilized Python as its main language. It was required that we follow the given rubric and criteria so that we could create our project based on the guidelines. In addition, we were also asked to use a flowchart to brainstorm and organize our ideas and additionally, to document all our code by using google docs and doc-strings within the code. </p>


      <h2> Description:</h2>
      <p>For this challenge, my partner and I decided to make our escape room project based off the theme of our class teacher, which would be Mr. Brown. To do this, we started a brainstorm session which highlighted key things that stood out in our teacher whether it meant his motto, quotes, or type of assignments he would always assign to us. In order to do this, we had to utilize a flowchart where we explained our decisions in if-else type statements and used our brainstormed ideas.  Whatever was on our flowchart, we implemented in our python code in a more detailed way which would appeal to the user that would be playing our escape room game. My role in this project was to help code the if-else statements and also take care of the documentation. Regarding the coding aspects, we had to define functions as this would be more faster and efficient instead of typing out everything. As it seemed pretty easy at first, we struggled over problems that related to our questions and answers. For example, at times the code would prompt the wrong question at times and also deem right answers as wrong. To fix this, my partner and I would try testing different parts of the code to analyze which parts were not working properly. We took advantage of our leadership skills to rightfully direct us to what we needed to do and made sure that we had an abundance of communication. This led to us creating a successful project.
