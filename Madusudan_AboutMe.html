    <p>Hi! My name is Akhil Madusudan and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School. Throughout my life, I have overcome many obstacles and struggles by being resourceful and disciplined. I use these skills to excel in whatever I put my mind too which means
      being dedicated and staying focused. Being responsible and dedicated is a need for me and my life, especially in my pursuit of becoming a software engineer. My goal is to graduate from college with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During
      my time at a 4-year college, I woul also like to apply for any computer science related internships to further increase my experience in this field and to expand my knowledge. After achieving this, I also plan on working for a great company as a software engineer and pursuing
      a master's degree in Computer Science. Software engineering lets me use all my exceptional skills to test new things and find solutions to problems. It is the best job for the unique qualities that I possess.<br> Having the best and most effective
      skills is extremely important to me like being responsible and intelligent. One of my best qualities is being able to brainstorm and engineer solutions to solve problems. I use these skills daily and apply it to the classes I take whether they are
      non-technical clases like English or Math to more tech-oriented classes like Design-Engineering and Computer Science. Recently, during the "Shelter-in-Place" order amid the Covid-19 pandemic, I have applied for courses relating to my career interests in means of improving and broadening my knowledge which included learning new developer languages like Python and JavaScript. 
      <br>Additionaly, I have also thrived by being a leader and knowing how to manage situations without any bad outcomes which ensures a productive
      workspace. I am also great respecting other co-workers and being social. People will be able to be comfortable and trust me, which will ensure a excellent work environment wherever I am. With
      these superior skills I have accomplished being a person that is known to be nice and social with a good reputation. My life has helped me discover different skills and talents such as being a leader and analyzing problems to help me on my path
      to a great career. I have been taught the importance of using my skills to help me prosper and succeed as an individual. Please feel free to contact to me if you have any questions and explore this site to find out about my interests, achievements,
      and more. Best Wishes! </p>
